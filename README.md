To run the app:

Clone the repo locally.
`cd` into the project and run `yarn` to install dependencies.
Run `yarn start` to start the app locally.

Points to note
Due to time constraint, please put the following into consideration:
- Very little form input validations were done.
- No tests were written, as really there's nothing to test. The app is a simple one and the highest logic is adding selection prices up.
- The web app is not responsive. Please view on a desktop/large screen device.
Inline styling was used to save time that would otherwise be used to create CSS files, classnames and rules. Also, no bogus styling package was used to reduce dependencies as instructed in the document.
